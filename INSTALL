Pygmy Installation(rough):

Python 2.x , tested solely on 2.7.2 but should be compatible with any recent 2.x version.
Python 3.x not currently supported.
All testing and development on Debian 5.0.8

One pre-req package will be needed to install pygmy.
Many pre-loaded python environments may have this package already. 
The package can be found in the following locations for example:
	Mysql-python - http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/ 
	Fedora: https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/MySQL-python
	Debian: http://packages.debian.org/sid/python-mysqldb
	Ubuntu: http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/python/python-mysqldb
	etc..	
	
Un-gzip & un-tar, from directory run "python setup.py install"
Install can be tested by running a python shell and typing 'import _mysql' or 'import MySQLdb'
No errors means success. 
"""
	#python
	>>>import _mysql
	>>>

Installation of pygmy involves 3 steps.
1) copy the four files from /cgi (pygmy.cgi|pygqry.cgi|pygeve.cgi|pygdmn.cgi) to your local cgi-bin folder. In Debian this is /usr/lib/cgi-bin/pyg*.cgi.
	1a) Chmod and chown the files as needed
		# chown root:www-data /usr/lib/cgi-bin/pyg*
		# chmod 750 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/pyg*
		~install script may handle this in the future
	1b) You may have to configure apache to utilize cgi
			Ref: "http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html"
	1c) You may also have to modify the first line of the pyg*.cgi files for your path to python
		They currently read "!#/usr/bin/python"
		The 'ScriptAlias' in httpd.conf can be refered to for this path.
		~install script may handle this in the future
	
2) Copy the /pyg.conf to the /etc directory (IE /etc/pyg.conf)
	The pyg.conf file contains DB info and proxy settings as such:
		"""
		 host=localhost
		 db=snort.db
		 user=username
		 passwd=password
		 proxy=127.0.0.1:80
		"""	
	2a) Modify the settings as needed. If no proxy is required or domain research functions are not desired use
	    127.0.0.1:81 or a similar dead end.
	2b) Permissions should be set on this file to allow apache2 (IE www-data in Debian) to access this file.
	    # chown root:www-data /etc/pyg.conf
	    # chmod 640 /etc/pyg.conf

3) Copy the /www/pygmy folder to your www document root (IE /var/www/pygmy/*)
	The folder contains:
		"""
		 /var/www/pygmy/
		  bullet.gif
		  minus.gif
		  mktree.css
		  mktree.js
		  plus.gif
		  popup.js
		  pyg.jpg
		"""
	3a) Permissions should be set appropriately for your web server
		# chmod 440 pyg*.cgi
		# chown root:www-data (Debian example)
		~install script may handle this in the future

4) Optionally you can copy the pygmy.html page to your document root to auto-redirect to the cgi
	# cp /pygmy/pygmy.html.sample /var/www/pygmy.html
	# chmod 440 /var/www/pygmy.html
	~install script may handle this in the future

Browse to http://your.host.tld/pygmy.html -or- http://your.host.tld/cgi-bin/pygmy.cgi
