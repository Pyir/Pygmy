Pygmy Installation(rough):

Requirements:
Python 2.x , tested with 2.7.2 but should be compatible with any recent 2.x versions.
Pygmy assumes you have a snort IDS environment with a standard mysql DB set up.
If you are starting fresh I would recommend an install guide from snort.org/docs to get started.

Python 2.7 , tested primarily on 2.7.1 but any recent 2.x should should be OK

MySQLdb/mysql-python
The package can be found at:
	Project: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/ 
	Fedora: https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/MySQL-python
	Debian: http://packages.debian.org/sid/python-mysqldb
	Ubuntu: http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/python/python-mysqldb
	etc..	

	>tar -xf MySQL-python-1.2.3.tar.gz
	>cd MySQL-python-1.2.3
	>python setup.py install
	>python	
		>>>import _mysql
		>>>
		No errors means success


Installation of pygmy involves 3 steps.
1) Copy the four cgi files from /cgi (pygmy.cgi|pygqry.cgi|pygeve.cgi|pygdmn.cgi) to your local cgi-bin folder. 
	(Debian: /usr/lib/cgi-bin/, Fedora: /var/www/cgi-bin/, etc)
	1a) Chmod and chown the files as needed
		IE:
		>chown root:www-data /usr/lib/cgi-bin/pyg*
		>chmod 750 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/pyg*

	1b) You may have to configure apache to utilize cgi
		Ref: "http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html"

	1c) You may also have to modify the first line of the pyg*.cgi files for your path to python
		They currently read "!#/usr/bin/python"
		The 'ScriptAlias' in httpd.conf can be refered to for this path or ">whereis python". Typically it's /usr/bin/python
	
2) Copy the /pyg.conf to the /etc directory (IE /etc/pyg.conf)a
	>cp ./pyg.conf.sample /etc/pyg.conf

	The pyg.conf file contains DB info and proxy settings as such:
		"""
		host=localhost
		db=snort.db
		user=username
		passwd=password
		proxy=127.0.0.1:80
		"""	

	2a) Modify the settings as needed. If no proxy is required or domain research functions are not desired remove the proxy= linei or leave it blank.

	2b) Permissions should be set on this file to allow apache2 (IE www-data in Debian) to access this file.
		>chown root:www-data /etc/pyg.conf
		>chmod 640 /etc/pyg.conf
	    

3) Copy the /www/pygmy folder to your www document root
	>cp ./pygmy /var/www or cp ./pygmy /var/www/html

	3a) Permissions should be set appropriately for your web server
		>chown root:www-data (Debian example)
		>chmod 550 /var/www/(html)/pygmy
		>chmod 440 /var/www/(html)/pygmy/*

4) Optionally you can copy the pygmy.html page to your document root to auto-redirect to the cgi
	>cp /pygmy/pygmy.html.sample /var/www/pygmy.html
	>chown root:www-data /var/www/pygmy.html	
	>chmod 440 /var/www/pygmy.html

5) SELinux users may need to run a "setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db on" to allow pygmy to connect to remote snort DBs.
